## Is Plan-it! for me?

Not every teacher is the same. Some may only teach for a couple periods, some may teach multiple period throughout the day multiple times a week. For those that use notebook/pen and paper, this can be inefficient and stressful especially if you were to lose your notebooks, lesson planners, etc.
